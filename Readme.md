This is the wrye bash meta repository, containing Bethesda forums
 posts, nexus description pages etc and some scripts to generate these.
The scripts use [PyGithub][1] to interface
with github - you must install it to use the scripts.
The content is distributed in the following directories:

- __scripts__: for generating forum posts, nexus descriptions, changelogs  etc by
 reading the wrye-bash/wrye-bash repository data. Depend on [PyGithub][1].
Contains the directories:
  * _scripts/templates_: contains templates for the scripts to operate upon (WIP)
  * _scripts/out (not versioned)_: used for outputting the posts
   that either belong to another repo (eg Version History.html) or change too
   frequently to be versioned (eg the second posts in the Bethesda forums)
- __FirstPosts__: forum thread starters, currently Oblivion and Skyrim. Generated by
`generate_first_posts.py - m 304.4` - need some manual tweaking.
- __ChangeLogs__: contains changelogs for the last few releases in the various text
formats needed (bbcode, html, markdown).
- __NexusDescriptionPages__ : currently must be updated manually - for Oblivion and
 Skyrim.
