[*]It makes it safe to try out new mods because it will restore everything to the way it was when you uninstall a mod
[*]It makes more mods compatible with each other by importing information from different mods into a "bashed patch"

[size=3][color=#3366ff]Requirements and Installation:[/color][/size]

[size=2][color=#3366ff]Short version:[/color][/size]

Just use the installer and install to the Oblivion folder! When you install dependencies, just install them to their default locations.

[size=2][color=#3366ff]Long version:[/color][/size]

There are two versions available: the Python version and the Standalone version. They are functionally equivalent. Most people should run the Standalone version since it is slightly simpler (no external Python components to install). You don't need to install the Python version, however, you can if you want to be more involved with development or if you already have Python installed on your system for other reasons.

If you are using the Python version, dependency installation will be handled automatically by the installer. However, if you want or need to do things manually, see the [url=http://wrye-bash.github.io/docs/Wrye%20Bash%20General%20Readme.html]General Readme[/url] for information, and the [url=http://wrye-bash.github.io/docs/Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html]Advanced Readme[/url] for detailed instructions.

Note that the 32-bit versions are required even if you are on a 64-bit operating system

Then:
[list]
[*]For manual installations of either the Standalone or Python versions, extract the archive in your Oblivion game folder so that the Mopy directory appears in the Oblivion directory[/*]
[*]For Python versions, run by double-clicking on Wrye Bash Launcher.pyw[/*]
[*]For WBSA (Wrye Bash StandAlone), run by double-clicking on Wrye Bash.exe[/*]
[/list]
Remember! In Windows Vista and up, don't install Oblivion in the Program Files folder due to User Account Control!

[color=#00BFFF]305 Bug fixes and enhancements [2014/08/23] [Various community members][/color]
[LIST]
[*]Due to the change from the BOSS API to the LOOT API, and due to internal changes in the way the Standalone is created, [b]no[/b] MSVC redistributables are required for either Python or Standalone Wrye Bash.[/*]

[*]Corrected errors with the DocBrowser when the set document file was missing. [lojack5][/*]
