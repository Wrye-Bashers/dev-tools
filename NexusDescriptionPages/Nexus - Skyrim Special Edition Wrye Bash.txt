[size=3][color=#3366ff]Requirements and Installation:[/color][/size]

[size=2][color=#3366ff]Short version:[/color][/size]

Just use the installer and install to the Skyrim Special Edition folder! When you install dependencies, just install them to their default locations.

[size=2][color=#3366ff]Long version:[/color][/size]

There are two versions available: the Python version and the Standalone version. They are functionally equivalent. Most people should run the Standalone version since it is slightly simpler (no external Python components to install). The Python version, however, allows you to follow the rapidly developed code and is therefore preferred.

Dependency installation for the Python version will be handled automatically by the installer. However, if you want or need to do things manually, see the installation sections on the [url=http://wrye-bash.github.io/docs/Wrye%20Bash%20General%20Readme.html#install]General Readme[/url] for information, and the [url=http://wrye-bash.github.io/docs/Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#install]Advanced Readme[/url] for detailed instructions.

Note that the 32-bit versions are required even if you are on a 64-bit operating system

Then:
[list]
[*]For manual installations of either the Standalone or Python versions, extract the archive in your Skyrim Special Edition game folder so that the Mopy directory appears in the Skyrim Special Edition directory[/*]
[*]For Python versions, run by double-clicking on Wrye Bash Launcher.pyw[/*]
[*]For WBSA (Wrye Bash StandAlone), run by double-clicking on Wrye Bash.exe[/*]
[/list]
Remember! In Windows Vista and up, don't install Skyrim Special Edition in the Program Files folder due to User Account Control!
