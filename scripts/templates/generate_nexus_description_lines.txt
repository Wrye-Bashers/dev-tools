[color=orange]Important: Wrye Bash needs developers.

If you are familiar with the Python programming language, please consider helping with development. We ported [url=https://github.com/wrye-bash/wrye-bash/]our repository[/url] to git at github to make contributing super easy.

[size=3][color=#3366ff]Requirements and Installation:[/color][/size]

[size=2][color=#3366ff]Short version:[/color][/size]

Just use the installer and install to the $game folder! When you install dependencies, just install them to their default locations.

[size=2][color=#3366ff]Long version:[/color][/size]

There are two versions available: the Python version and the Standalone version. They are functionally equivalent. Most people should run the Standalone version since it is slightly simpler (no external Python components to install). You don't need to install the Python version, however, you can if you want to be more involved with development or if you already have Python installed on your system for other reasons.

If you are using the Python version, dependency installation will be handled automatically by the installer. However, if you want or need to do things manually, see the [url=http://wrye-bash.github.io/docs/Wrye%20Bash%20General%20Readme.html]General Readme[/url] for information, and the [url=http://wrye-bash.github.io/docs/Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html]Advanced Readme[/url] for detailed instructions.

Note that the 32-bit versions are required even if you are on a 64-bit operating system

Then:

[*]For manual installations of either the Standalone or Python versions, extract the archive in your $game game folder so that the Mopy directory appears in the $game directory[/*]
[*]For Python versions, run by double-clicking on Wrye Bash Launcher.pyw[/*]
[*]For WBSA (Wrye Bash StandAlone), run by double-clicking on Wrye Bash.exe[/*]
[/list]
Remember! In Windows Vista and up, don't install $game in the Program Files folder due to User Account Control!
