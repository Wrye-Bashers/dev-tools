305 Bug fixes and enhancements [2014/08/23] [Various community members]

- Due to the change from the BOSS API to the LOOT API, and due to internal changes in the way the Standalone is created, **no** MSVC redistributables are required for either Python or Standalone Wrye Bash.
- Corrected the "Cannot load plugins before masters" error that many users were experiencing. [WrinklyNinja]
- Corrected the "'int' object has no attribute 'startswith'" error that often happened when using the Race Patcher. [jfpelland]
- The Standalone no longer reads loose Python files.  This was originally a method to allow small updates, however it ends up causing problems if you have Python files from an older Wrye Bash along side a newer Stadnalone. [lojack5]
- Corrected an error when adding a shortcut to a batch script to the Apps folder. [jfpelland]
- Corrected errors with the DocBrowser when the set document file was missing. [lojack5]
- Corrected BAIN Regression: BAIN was not uninstalling all files.  This was affecting both uninstalling and annealling. [lojack5]
- Corrected a few rare Wizard exceptions. [lojack5]
- Corrected an error for some users with Backup Bash Settings. [jfpelland]
- Corrected an error in the Installers Tab after deleting a Save Game. [lojack5]
- Corrected an issue that caused the Bashed Patch Tweak Settings to be non-persistent. [lojack5]
