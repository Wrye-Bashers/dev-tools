<h2>305 Bug fixes and enhancements [2014/08/23] [Various community members]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Due to the change from the BOSS API to the LOOT API, and due to internal changes in the way the Standalone is created, <strong>no</strong> MSVC redistributables are required for either Python or Standalone Wrye Bash.</li>
<li>Corrected the "Cannot load plugins before masters" error that many users were experiencing. [WrinklyNinja]</li>
<li>Corrected the "'int' object has no attribute 'startswith'" error that often happened when using the Race Patcher. [jfpelland]</li>
<li>The Standalone no longer reads loose Python files.  This was originally a method to allow small updates, however it ends up causing problems if you have Python files from an older Wrye Bash along side a newer Stadnalone. [lojack5]</li>
<li>Corrected an error when adding a shortcut to a batch script to the Apps folder. [jfpelland]</li>
<li>Corrected errors with the DocBrowser when the set document file was missing. [lojack5]</li>

<li>Corrected an error for some users with Backup Bash Settings. [jfpelland]</li>
<li>Corrected an error in the Installers Tab after deleting a Save Game. [lojack5]</li>

<li>Includes bluesky404's updates for Chinese Traditional and Simplified. [bluesky404/Sharlikran]</li>
